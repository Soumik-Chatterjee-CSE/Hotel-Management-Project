# Hotel-Management-Project
Firstly we create a database named
Hotel_management in mysql
And connect it to python ny uing sql and python
connector.
Under these database there are four tables;
1.bills
2.resbill
3.resitems
4.rooms
In these ‘rooms’ and ‘bills’ are used to store data of
customer and their booking details and calculate their
bills of room, while ‘resitem’ and ‘resbills’ are used to
store the data of restaurant services.
The project starts with representing the hotel name
(G.P.A) and gives us different choice:
1.Rooms & Suites
2.Restaurant
3.Booking Details
4.Cancel Your Booking
5.Exit
 ‘Rooms & Suites’ are used for booking room ,and
at the last display their booking details.
 ‘Restaurant’ is used to eating purpose it shows us
the menu and gives us our desired products.
 ‘Booking Details’ are used for checking the
Booking Info of Customer by their name, room
number and it can also display all the booking
details as per our need.
 ‘Cancel Your Booking’ is used to cancel our
booking by Room number and by Customer
name.
 ‘Exit ‘is used for exiting from the program.
In these whole programming database we have used
different features like:
1.We have made use of functions
2.We have use the concept of local and global
variables
3.If,elif and else statements.
4.cursor,commit –connector of mysql with python
5.we also have use a sort of while loop and looping in
list and tuples etc.
